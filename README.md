# cup-plant
Summary:
A project studying cup plant (Silphium perfoliatum) foliar and aboveground tissue C:N stoichiometry over the growing season and across a community diversity gradient ranging from planted richness 2 to planted richness 12.

Study Site:
Iowa State University’s Field Extension Education Laboratory (FEEL)
in Boone County, Iowa (42o00.318’N, 93o47.272’W).

Sampling Dates:
Sampling was carried out from June 9, 2016 through September 16, 2016, with total aboveground tissue destructive sampling taking place on November 16-17, 2016. Pre-flowering leaf sampling date: June 18, 2016; Flowering leaf sampling date: July 21, 2016; Post-flowering sampling date: September 16, 2016.

Analysis:
Leaves were sampled compositely from each of 16 plots at the dates described above. These were ground and analyzied for percent TC and percent TN, and weighed for dry mass at the ISU soil and plant tissue analysis lab. Total aboveground tissue of cup plant and the rest of the communities were destructively sampled to a standardized point near the soil surface on the date noted above. This tissue was also ground and analyzed at the ISU soil and plant and tissue analysis lab, but only percent TN was obtained along with dried biomass for most plots. A few plot masses are unavailable due to an error at the lab.
