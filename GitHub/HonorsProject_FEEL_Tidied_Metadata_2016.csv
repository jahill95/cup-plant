cn,Carbon:Nitrogen Molar Ratio,(ptc (%) * dweight (g) / Carbon Molar Mass (12.01 g/mol)) / (ptn (%) * dweight (g) / Nitrogen Molar Mass (14.01 g/mol)),C:N is the primary response variable of interest for both leaves and total aboveground tissue. Masses were converted to molar ratios because of conventions used in Sterner & Elser (2002).  ,JH
